# Double_Lyrics
last UPD on Feb 10 2022

This project creates a double lyrics text file using `googletrans` module.
Also there's a Timer class in the `timer.py` file that is used inside a context manager to measure execution time.

# User input:
1. Assign the desired language output to a `final_lang` variable.
Available languages are listed in the `translator.py` file.

2. Assign the source file location to a `source_file` variable.

3. Assign the output file destination to a `file_destination` variable.
Optionally, you can change the file's name.
By default, the `heading` variable takes the first translated line as a title.
